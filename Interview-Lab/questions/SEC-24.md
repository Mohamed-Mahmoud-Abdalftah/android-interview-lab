# SEC-24

## Original interview question

How can native code/JNI be analyzed or instrumented?

## What the interviewer evaluates

- JNI/native code visibility to static and runtime analysis.
- Why native placement does not protect an embedded secret.

## Explanation in Arabic

JNI بينقل جزء من المنطق لـ`.so` native library، لكنه بيتشحن للمستخدم داخل APK. ممكن يعملوا disassemble، strings extraction، hook للـJNI boundary أو native function، ويتابعوا plaintext وقت الاستخدام. native code ممكن يصعّب التحليل شوية، لكن ما يخليش API key سرّ ولا يلغي server authorization.

## Practical walkthrough

لو SDK دفع فيه `.so` وفيه فحص `approved`, المهاجم يقدر يhook JNI return أو patch native instruction، مش شرط يعرف كل source. اختبر backend مع result معدّلة ومبلغ متغيّر، ولا تعتمد على native flag كقرار دفع نهائي. native code ممكن يقدم أداء أو integration مع hardware، لكنه يزيد مساحة memory safety وABI compatibility كمان.

## Why it matters and how it works

Native libraries expose symbols, machine code, constants and calls that can be inspected with reverse-engineering tools. Even if stripped, inputs and outputs cross Java/native boundaries and can be instrumented. Root expands access, but package inspection alone can reveal embedded material.

## Worked example

A vendor EMV SDK exposes `authorize(request)` through JNI. The app treats the SDK result as evidence requiring backend/provider confirmation and records a stable operation ID. A private acquirer key remains on the server or certified secure hardware path, not in a native string constant.

## Trade-offs and decision criteria

Native code can improve performance or meet vendor integration needs, and stripping/obfuscation can increase analysis cost. It also adds ABI packaging, memory-safety and release-testing risks; it is not a confidentiality boundary.

## Failure modes

A team moves a bearer secret from BuildConfig into `libpayment.so` and declares it safe. A strings scan or hook at the call site retrieves it. Rotate the exposed key and relocate privileged operations to a trusted backend.

## Production perspective

Security tests inspect APK libraries, ABI variants and runtime request paths; release rollout includes native crash monitoring. Server enforces transaction identity, amount and authorization independent of SDK/client claims.

## Interview answer — short

“JNI does not hide an APK secret. Native libraries can be disassembled or hooked, and values are observable at the Java/native boundary. I use native code for its real engineering purpose and keep authority server-side.”

## Interview answer — structured

“A `.so` file is distributed with the APK. Attackers can inspect instructions and strings, and instrument both JNI calls and native functions. Stripping symbols may slow analysis but does not make a shared key unextractable. I keep private payment credentials on the backend, validate SDK callbacks against provider/server records, and test native libraries across shipped ABIs and release variants. ”

## Interview answer — deep senior

“I review native code as an additional attack and reliability surface. I inspect packaged ABIs, symbol stripping, memory-safety posture and callback behavior; then I test with a hostile client that changes native return values. A native SDK can provide a certified hardware or EMV integration, but the app must not equate its local callback with final financial truth. Backend reconciliation and idempotent operation identity protect against tampering and crash recovery. Any secret embedded in the `.so` is treated as exposed and rotated if it had privilege. In a review I would inventory the packaged ABIs and native dependencies, inspect the JNI boundary for plaintext and privileged calls, and test with a patched return value. I would also check memory-safety updates and crash reporting for the native SDK. If the provider requires certified hardware, I would rely on its attested protocol rather than assuming a `.so` library is equivalent to secure hardware. The backend verifies the final provider status.”

## How to answer in the interview

- **Why:** compiled native code is still distributed to attackers.
- **How:** inspect JNI boundaries, ABI packages, strings, and runtime hooks.
- **Trade-off:** native integration adds performance or hardware access with extra safety complexity.
- **Failure case:** treating a patched native approval as authority.
- **Production solution:** server/provider confirmation and native crash/security testing.

## Deep-dive talking points

Prompt for static native inspection, JNI hooking, ABI testing, SDK callback trust and backend authority.

## Follow-up questions

- [SEC-05](../sec-05/): Can a native constant be secret? **Answer:** no; it ships in the binary.
- [PAY-14](../pay-14/): What is a native rollout risk? **Answer:** ABI-specific load or runtime failures.

## Self-check rubric

Can I explain static and dynamic native analysis and why server trust is still needed?
