# SEC-29

## Original interview question

A rooted device can hook your code with Frida. What protections help and what can they not guarantee?

## What the interviewer evaluates

- Root/Frida bypassability and layered risk control.
- Backend invariants and operational false-positive policy.

## Explanation in Arabic

Frida على rooted device تقدر تhook methods، تغيّر return values، تقرأ plaintext قبل encryption أو بعد TLS، وتعدّي root/pin checks. Obfuscation وintegrity signals تزود كلفة الهجوم وتفيد risk engine، لكن مفيش ضمان إن client نظيف. الحماية الأساسية للمال: server authorization، transaction state، idempotency، limits وreconciliation.

## Why it matters and how it works

Runtime instrumentation acts within the app process or its environment. Hardware-backed keys may resist extraction, yet an attacker can ask the app to use them or observe input/output. Play Integrity provides server-consumed app/device signals with tiered enforcement; it is not an absolute anti-hook proof.

## Worked example

A hook forces `isDeviceTrusted()` to true and changes transfer amount in the outgoing request. The backend recomputes request binding, verifies the session and beneficiary, applies amount limits, and rejects altered/stale operation details. High-risk devices may receive step-up or reduced limits.

## Trade-offs and decision criteria

Hard blocks deter some abuse but can exclude legitimate users and be bypassed. Soft signals improve availability but need stronger server monitoring. Choose policy by threat model and measure false-positive/false-negative outcomes.

## Failure modes

Client-only root check at startup is trivially patchable; accepting a local SDK callback as payment success is equally unsafe. Test hooks on critical decision paths and assert backend invariants survive them.

## Production perspective

Incident telemetry records verdict categories and opaque operation IDs, not card data. Risk rules are versioned, reversible and monitored for device cohorts; support has a safe appeal path.

## Interview answer — short

“Root and Frida can bypass client checks and observe runtime data. I use tamper signals as defense in depth, while backend authorization, limits, idempotency and reconciliation protect financial outcomes.”

## Interview answer — structured

“On a rooted device an attacker can hook Java or native functions, change local decisions and inspect plaintext at use time. R8, root detection, pinning and even hardware-backed keys raise cost for some attacks but do not prove the client is clean. I put transaction rules on the backend, use integrity verdicts as server-verified risk signals, and choose tiered responses with false-positive monitoring.”

## Interview answer — deep senior

“I assume a hostile client can forge any field it sends and can bypass local security checks. My backend verifies account ownership, canonical amount, operation identity and allowed state transitions, and reconciles provider outcomes. For additional friction I may use Play Integrity, short-lived credentials, step-up challenges, anti-tamper checks and anomaly detection, but I test with Frida to make sure bypass does not grant authority. I monitor legitimate-device rejection rates and provide controlled recovery. Keystore key extraction resistance does not stop a hook from observing plaintext or invoking an authorized operation through the app.”

## Deep-dive talking points

Prompt for hookable client Boolean, hardware-key use-site, server invariants, tiered risk and false positives.

## Follow-up questions

- [SEC-21](../sec-21/): Where is a verdict checked? **Answer:** the backend, bound to a request.
- [SEC-27](../sec-27/): What defeats a patched payment flag? **Answer:** server-derived state and provider confirmation.

## Self-check rubric

Can I state what each local defense can and cannot protect and identify a backend invariant?
